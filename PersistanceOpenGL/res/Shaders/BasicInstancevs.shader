 //

 //so hear me out, for vertex shader ligthing, we could calculate with glposition the difference between the positions of the ligths and the positions of the vertices to, therefore, calculate the correct diffuse value
 // wouldn't that be ideal? we could use the same methods that wer're currently using in the fragment shader, thus making the whole operation cheaper, and making the correct ligthing even easier using gl_Position
